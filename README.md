# MorseCode LED Transmitter
ARM Cortex-M3 project built in Keil ÂµVision and written in ARMv7 Assembly for the NXP LPC1768 microcontroller. It reads characters from a string, converts them to Morse code, and blinks an on-board LED to transmit the encoded pattern. Implements bit-level control, memory-mapped I/O, custom delay loops, and LUT-based Morse decoding using shift-and-mask logic.
